Application: Bob is planning to develop an automated restaurant suggestion app like Yelp. This app
should be able to recommend restaurants based on the factors of ‘price’ and 'ratings'. Your task is to
answer the following questions:
1. Explain how this algorithm can help in application development.
-The algoritm will allow the user to select price a ratings as a way of filtering the data in the hash table.

2. Can you suggest a third factor which can be included in this kind of recommendation app? For
example: the distance from your location.
Another attribute that would be useful when looking at resturants and their data could be the times that they are open. There could be a new object that is a 2D array of strings where in array 1 there is days of the week Monday-Sunday. And then at each cell (day of the week) there is a string "open-close".
